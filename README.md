This is the eigth project of the Main HTML/CSS curriculum at [Microverse](https://www.microverse.org/). The goal was to create a grid-based framework and use it to clone any website. The project was completed using simple HTML, CSS and Sass. You can see the detailed project specs [here](https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/html5-and-css3/lessons/design-your-own-grid-based-framework).
